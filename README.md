My Project to do with toner management

While working on my placement I had the opportunity to talk with partners. One issue that occurred quite regularly was that partners are unable to estimate accurately toner usage per customer. This caused monetary loss and reduced the ease of making a profit through click charge sales (where the customer gets the printer and toner for free but is charged on a per print basis). To be able to do this partner need certain information from customers such as toner percentage, toner coverage and printing counters. Current solutions do exist however they do not collect all this data and present it in a user-friendly way that can improve these estimations. Partners also struggled with dispatching toner as in some cases cartridges were shaken and then replaced making it appear as if they were not low.
A further issue that was raised was that toner low alarms must be physically set on a device by an engineer in this case they will now show the toner low dependant on what the customer sets in the dashboard is the hope.

The Idea of this project is to address this issue by creating a dashboard web tool using data provided to display the toner percentage, coverage and printing counters as well as provide analysis of these that helps the partners to be able to accurately estimate toner usage per customer.
